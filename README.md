# FakeCo-Meeting-Schedule

###Objective
My objective was to take a wireframe of FakeCo's meeting schedule and turn it into a working prototype. The main goal was to make sure all information regarding meetings was viewable at a glance, as they were no peripherals attached.

I stuck to basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript as well as JQuery and Moment.js for time.

I decided to go with horizontal scrolling as I think it's the most easily readable and informative. I didn't get a chance to update the rooms when occupied, though it does notify the viewer when a meeting is upcoming.
