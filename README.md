# FakeCo-Meeting-Schedule

###Objective
My objective was to take a wireframe of FakeCo's meeting schedule and turn it into a working prototype. The main goal was to make sure all information regarding meetings was viewable at a glance, as they were no peripherals attached.

I stuck to basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript as well as JQuery and Moment.js for time.
